# 🐾 Zoo Management Game (C++ + SQLite)

Welcome to the **Zoo Management Game**, a terminal-based project built with C++ and SQLite3. This game lets you manage animals, exhibits, and caretaking tasks in a simplified zoo simulation. It was built as a hands-on project using Replit and demonstrates concepts like data persistence, object-oriented programming, and simple game logic.

---

## 🧰 Features

- 🦁 Add, update, and remove animals
- 🏞️ Create and manage exhibits
- 👩‍⚕️ Record animal care and feeding logs
- 🗂️ Save and load data using **SQLite3**
- 🔧 Built using `Makefile` and Replit’s custom configuration (`.replit`, `replit.nix`)

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- **C++**
- **SQLite3** – for storing animal, exhibit, and caretaker records
- **Makefile** – for compilation and build automation
- **Replit** – as the development environment

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brando008/zoo-management-game.git
cd zoo-management-game
```

### 2. Install dependencies (if not using Replit)
Make sure you have sqlite3 installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
```

### 3. Compile and Run

```bash
make
./main
```
